Network Incident Reporting and Documentation Portal

Student Final Project for Networking Technologies(COMP214) Course

The Network Incident Reporting and Documentation Portal (NIRDP) is a web-based application that
allows users to report network incidents, categorize them based on severity, and automatically generate
incident reports. The project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in frontend and backend
development, database design, and cybersecurity practices to ensure the portal's security.
