			The Network Incident Reporting and Documentation Portal (NIRDP) is a web-based application that allows users to report network incidents, categorize them based on severity, and automatically generate incident reports. The project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in frontend and backend development, database design, and cybersecurity practices to ensure the portal's security.
